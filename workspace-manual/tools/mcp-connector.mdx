## What is the MCP connector?

The **MCP Connector** lets you connect to remote MCP servers and use them directly in chat. Instead of calling APIs manually, you can simply integrate the MCP server as a tool in your workspace.

<Warning> 
Ask your IT administrator to enable the MCP Connector in your system configuration [with the Operator Manual](/operator-manual/customize#features) 
</Warning>

## Connect to your MCP server

1. **Open any chat** where you want to use MCP information  
2. **Click the tool selector**  
3. **Select "Add connection to MCP server"**  
4. **Enter your connection details** in the popup window

### Requirements

Currently, only **remote MCP servers** are supported, and they must meet the following conditions:

- **No authorization required** or **OAuth enabled**  
- **CORS enabled**  
- Must be accessible from the same network as Zylon (just like any other service Zylon needs to connect to)  

Your IT team can help ensure your MCP server is properly exposed for integration.

## What you can do once connected

After connecting, you can use MCP server tools and data directly in chat, for example:

- Query APIs exposed through the MCP server  
- Run analysis tasks configured in the MCP server  
- Retrieve structured data into your workspace conversations  

<Info> 
**Limitations**:  
- Currently supports **remote MCP servers only**  
- Some MCP servers wrap large APIs, so tool results can be very large and may **overflow the context window**  
- Queries automatically stop after 10 minutes
