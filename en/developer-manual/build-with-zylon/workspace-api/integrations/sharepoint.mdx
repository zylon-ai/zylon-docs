description: "Sync SharePoint documents into your workspace."

SharePoint integrations ingest libraries and documents into your workspace. **Enable SharePoint at the instance level first**—see the operator guide: [SharePoint integration setup](/en/operator-manual/knowledge-base/sharepoint).

If OAuth is required, use the login endpoints in [OpenID & OAuth](/en/developer-manual/build-with-zylon/workspace-api/authentication/openid).

## Basic request and response

Fetch integration configuration with `GET /v1/app/integration/sharepoint/{integrationId}/config`.

```bash
curl "https://{base_url}/v1/app/integration/sharepoint/sp_1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d/config" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}"
```

Example response (schema not defined in OpenAPI):

```json
{
  "site_url": "https://auroralabs.sharepoint.com/sites/support",
  "library": "Shared Documents"
}
```

## Start an ingest sync

```bash
curl -X POST "https://{base_url}/v1/app/integration/sharepoint/sp_1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d/ingest" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}"
```

Example response (SyncEvent):

```json
{
  "type": "sync_started",
  "current_artifact_count": 18,
  "integration_item_count": 64
}
```
