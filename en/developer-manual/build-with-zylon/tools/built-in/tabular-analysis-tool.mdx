Use Tabular Analysis when you want the assistant to compute answers from structured data (for example: “average by group”, “max value”, “trend over time”).

## Prerequisites

```bash
export API_TOKEN="YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

If you don’t have a token yet, see [Token Management](/en/api-reference/token-management).

## Requirements

- Tool spec: `{ "name": "tabular_analysis", "type": "tabular_analysis_v1" }`
- `tool_context`: at least one `ingested_artifact` containing tabular data (CSV/Excel/table)

## Basic request and response

```bash
curl -X POST "https://{base_url}/gpt/v1/messages/validate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "default",
    "max_tokens": 128,
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "What is the row with the highest value?" }
    ],
    "tools": [
      { "name": "tabular_analysis", "type": "tabular_analysis_v1" }
    ],
    "tool_choice": { "type": "auto" },
    "tool_context": [
      {
        "type": "ingested_artifact",
        "context_filter": { "collection": "docs_examples" }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Example response:

```json
{ "valid": true, "errors": null }
```

To run the request, send the same body to `POST /messages`.

## Tips

- Ingest CSVs with good headers.
- If your table is embedded in a PDF, consider ingesting the table as a separate artifact to improve accuracy.
