Each project can define **custom instructions** that the AI uses on **every interaction in that project**. These augment (they don’t replace) the organization‑wide company context.

- Use the **Context** box for background: what this project is for, who it serves, key acronyms, etc.
- Use the **Format** box for response style rules (e.g., “answer in French”, “bullet points only”).

> **Behavior:** Custom instructions apply to all new chats in the project. Combined with the org “company context”, they let you shape project‑specific “mini‑agents”.
