# MCP Connector

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Connector allows you to integrate external MCP servers into a **Project**,exposing their tools to the LLM in a controlled and shareable way.

> **Important change**: MCP connectors are no longer added directly inside chats. They are now **project-level shared connectors**.

<Warning>
    Ask your IT administrator to enable the MCP Connector in your system configuration [with the Operator Manual](/en/operator-manual/configuration/features).
</Warning>

## Creating an MCP Connector

To create an MCP connector:

1. Open your **Project Sidebar**
2. Click **Connectors**
3. Click **Create connector**
4. Select **MCP**
5. Configure the **MCP connection details**
6. Check **Bearer Auth** and set the token if you MCP requires it
7. Establish the connection

Once the connection is successful, you can configure which MCP tools are available.

## Tool Selection

After the MCP connection is established, you must select the tools the connector will expose.

### Why Tool Selection Matters

- Limits what the LLM can invoke
- Reduces noise and unintended behavior
- Improves reliability and safety

You can:
- Enable or disable individual tools
- Update tool selection later without recreating the connector

Only selected tools will be available when the connector is used in a chat.

## Using the MCP Connector in Chat

Once created, MCP connectors can be used in chats:

1. Open or create a chat within the project
2. Use the **Connectors selector** in the chat input
3. Enable the MCP connector

The LLM will then be able to invoke the selected MCP tools during the conversation.

## Pre-Selected Connectors

Project administrators can configure MCP connectors to be **automatically enabled for every new chat** in the project.

This is recommended when:
- MCP tools are a standard part of the workflow
- Users should not manually manage tool selection
- The project relies on consistent tool availability

---

## Personal and Private MCPs

If a user wants to add or experiment with **personal MCP connectors**:

1. Create a **private project**
2. Create MCP connectors using the same creation flow
3. Use those connectors only within that project

This allows safe experimentation without impacting shared projects.

---

## Requirements and Considerations

- The MCP server must be reachable from the connector environment
- Only MCP-compliant tools are supported
- Tool permissions are enforced based on connector configuration

---

## Security

- Only selected tools are exposed to the LLM
- MCP connectors do not grant unrestricted access
- Tool availability is controlled at the connector level
