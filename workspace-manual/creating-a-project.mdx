Projects are the workspaces where chats, agent flows, and a project-specific knowledge base live. When you create a project, it is **created in your private space by default** (visible only to you).

## Steps
1. Go to **Projects** and select **New project**.
2. Enter a name.
3. Create. The project appears under **PRIVATE** on the left column.

> **Tip:** You can **pin** projects to keep personal shortcuts. Pinning is a perâ€‘user convenience and does not affect other users.
