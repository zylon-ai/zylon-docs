The Workspace API powers administration and management for your Zylon deployment. Use it to manage orgs and users, create projects, run threaded chats, ingest artifacts, configure integrations, and pull analytics or audit trails.

## Base URL

All Workspace endpoints live under:

```
https://{base_url}/v1
```

## Authentication

Most endpoints require an API token. If you don’t have one yet, see [Token Management](/en/api-reference/token-management).

## Basic request and response

Use `GET /v1/app/me` to verify your token and user context:

```bash
curl "https://{base_url}/v1/app/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}"
```

## Pagination

List endpoints return a page envelope with cursors:

```json
{
  "data": [],
  "next_cursor": "cursor_next",
  "previous_cursor": "cursor_prev",
  "has_next_page": false,
  "has_previous_page": false,
  "total_count": 0
}
```

Use `page`, `page_size`, `after`, `before`, `first`, `last`, and `total_count` when they’re available on the endpoint.

## Errors and edge cases

- **401/403**: token missing or insufficient permissions.
- **404**: resource IDs are invalid or deleted.
- **Redirect endpoints**: login/callback routes return `302` responses intended for browsers.
