## Querying your documents

1. Start a new chat in the relevant **project**.
2. (Optional) **Scope** the chat to a **folder** if you know where the answer lives.
3. Ask your question. The assistant retrieves relevant snippets and replies with **citations** you can open to the exact passage.
4. If needed, refine the question or adjust the folder scope.

> You can also paste a **URL** in the prompt to fetch and use the content from that page for the current turn.

## Editing the Latest Chat Query

Users can edit **only the latest query** in a chat.

When editing a query:

- Only the **most recent message** can be edited
- All **initial inputs** can be modified (prompt, connectors, parameters, tools, etc.)
- The previous version of the query is **removed and replaced** by the edited one

This ensures the chat history remains consistent and avoid context to get corrupted.

## Deleting the Latest Chat Query

Chat queries can also be deleted, with the same restriction:

- **Only the latest query** in the chat can be deleted

Deleting a query:

- Removes the question and its associated response
- Does not affect earlier messages in the conversation

This is useful when a query was sent by mistake or is no longer relevant.

## Retrying Failed Chat Queries

If a chat query fails, users can retry it.

Retrying a failed query allows you to:

- Re-run the same question
- **Modify inputs and parameters** before retrying
- Fix issues caused by incorrect connectors, tools, or prompt configuration

This is especially useful when failures are related to:

- Invalid or missing inputs
- Misconfigured connectors
- Tool execution errors

The retried query replaces the failed one, keeping the chat clean and easy to follow.
