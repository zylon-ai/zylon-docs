## General networking

Zylon Kubernetes cluster is based on k0s, which uses Calico as the default CNI (Container Network Interface).

For a full reference of what port
s need to be open in your firewall please refer to the official k0s documentation: https://docs.k0sproject.io/latest/networking/

## Configure a proxy for the kubernetes cluster

If your system is running in a local network that requires a proxy to access the internet you will need
to configure it in the systemd service that runs the kubernetes cluster.

On top of the regular /etc/environment file you will need to create a
drop-in file for the k0scontroller service.

The file should be located at:

`/etc/systemd/system/k0scontroller.service.d/proxy.conf`

```
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=..."
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=..."
Environment="NO_PROXY=..."
```

After you apply the changes, restart the k0scontroller service

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart k0scontroller
```
