title: "AI Presets"
---

The Zylon AI inferencing engine is the core component that runs artificial intelligence models on your hardware. To ensure optimal performance and prevent startup failures, you must configure the system with the correct preset based on your available GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) memory.

## 1. What are AI Presets?

AI presets are pre-configured settings that optimize the AI models and memory allocation for your specific hardware setup. Each preset is carefully tuned to:

- Load the appropriate AI model size for your GPU memory
- Allocate memory efficiently to prevent crashes
- Balance performance with available resources
- Enable specific capabilities when needed

**Important**: Selecting an incorrect preset will prevent the inference engine from starting. The system does not automatically detect your GPU capacity, so manual configuration is required.

## 2. Understanding GPU Memory Requirements

Your GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) has a specific amount of VRAM (Video Random Access Memory) that determines which AI models can run effectively. AI models require substantial memory to operate, and larger models with better capabilities need more VRAM.

**How to check your GPU memory:**

- Use `nvidia-smi` command
- Refer to your hardware documentation

## 3. Presets

Set the AI preset in your Zylon configuration file using the `ai.preset` property. The default configuration uses a 24GB setup.

### 3.1 Base Presets

| Preset         | Required GPU Memory | Compatible Hardware Examples  |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `baseline-24g` | 24GB                | RTX 4090, L4, RTX 3090 Ti     |
| `baseline-32g` | 32GB                | RTX 5090                      |
| `baseline-48g` | 48GB                | RTX A6000, A40, L40, L40s     |
| `baseline-96g` | 96GB                | A100 80GB, H100, A6000 (dual) |

Choose the preset that matches your GPU memory capacity. **Always select a preset that matches or is lower than your available VRAM.**

```yaml
ai:
  preset: "baseline-48g"  # For a system with L40s (48GB)
```

### 3.2 Alternative Presets

Zylon also provides alternative presets that offer specialized configurations trading certain capabilities for others. These are optional and should only be used when you have specific requirements that differ from the standard presets.

```yaml
# For document and image processing
ai:
  preset: "alternatives.baseline-96g-vision"

# For extended context processing
ai:
  preset: "alternatives.baseline-48g-context"
```

#### Vision-Enabled Alternatives

These presets include specialized computer vision capabilities in the ingestion pipeline, allowing the system to process and understand images, documents, and visual content.
Useful for document digitization, image analysis or slide understanding.

| Preset                             | Required GPU Memory | Trade-off                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `alternatives.baseline-48g-vision` | 48GB                | Smaller model (Qwen 3 14B) |
| `alternatives.baseline-96g-vision` | 96GB                | Smaller model (Qwen 3 14B) |

**When to use vision-enabled presets:**

- Processing scanned documents, necessity of slide understanding
- Analyzing charts, graphs, and visual data
- Image understanding and description tasks

<Note>
  These presets are only available in Zylon versions that support images.
</Note>

#### Context-Optimized Alternatives

These presets use smaller AI models to provide significantly larger context windows.

| Preset                              | Required GPU Memory | Trade-off                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `alternatives.baseline-48g-context` | 48GB                | Smaller model (Qwen 3 14B) |
| `alternatives.baseline-96g-context` | 96GB                | Smaller model (Qwen 3 14B) |

**When to use context-optimized presets:**

- Extended conversation sessions
- Complex analysis requiring large amounts of context

**Important**: Using more context windows does not always yield better results.

## 4. Enhanced Capabilities (Optional)

Zylon supports additional capabilities that can be combined with any base or alternative preset. These capabilities extend the functionality but are **not enabled by default**.

| Capability     | Description                                   | Example Use Cases                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `multilingual` | Enhanced support for languages beyond English | International documents, non-English content processing |

Capabilities are added to presets using a comma-separated format: `<base_preset>,<capability1>,<capability2>`

```yaml
# Base preset with multilingual capability
ai:
  preset: "baseline-24g,capabilities.multilingual"

# Alternative preset with multilingual capability
ai:
  preset: "alternatives.baseline-48g-context,capabilities.multilingual"
```

## 5. Multi-GPU Configuration (Optional)

If your system has multiple GPUs, you can combine their memory capacity. Select the preset based on **total combined VRAM** across all GPUs.

### Multi-GPU Setup Steps

1. Calculate total VRAM: Add up the memory of all GPUs
2. Select the appropriate preset for the total memory
3. Configure the number of GPUs in your configuration

```yaml
ai:
  preset: "baseline-48g"
  numGPUs: 2  # Using 2 GPUs with 24GB each (48GB total)
```

### Multi-GPU Examples

| Hardware Setup | Individual GPU Memory | Total VRAM | Recommended Preset | Configuration |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| 2x RTX 4090    | 24GB each             | 48GB       | `baseline-48g`     | `numGPUs: 2`  |
| 2x L4          | 24GB each             | 48GB       | `baseline-48g`     | `numGPUs: 2`  |
| 4x RTX 4090    | 24GB each             | 96GB       | `baseline-96g`     | `numGPUs: 4`  |

## 6. Deprecated Presets (Legacy Support)

For customers that require older configurations, deprecated presets are available but not recommended for new installations.

| Preset Pattern                | Description                     | Recommendation                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `deprecated.<size>g.20250710` | Pre-Qwen 3 model configurations | Upgrade to current presets when possible |

**Example**: `deprecated.24g.20250710` for legacy 24GB configuration

<Warning>
  Eventually, we can decide to remove completely a deprecated preset. Please be aware that it can happen.
</Warning>

## 7. Troubleshooting

**Engine fails to start with memory error:**

1. Verify your actual GPU memory with `nvidia-smi`
2. Try the next lower preset (e.g., `baseline-24g` instead of `baseline-32g`)
3. Remove optional capabilities to reduce memory usage
4. Check for other applications using GPU memory.
5. Reboot the machine

**Poor performance or slow responses:**

1. Ensure you're using the correct preset for your hardware
2. Consider decreasing to a lower-tier preset
3. Consider communicate with Zylon engieneers to understand what it is happening
