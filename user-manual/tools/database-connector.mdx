# Database Connector

The Database Connector allows you to securely connect a shared database to a **Project**, making its data available to all project members through chat.

> **Important change**: Database connectors are no longer added directly inside a chat. They are now **project-level shared connectors**, managed from the Project sidebar.

---

## Creating a Database Connector

To create a database connector:

1. Open your **Project**.
2. Click **Connectors** in the project sidebar.
3. Click **Create Connector**.
4. Select **Database**.
5. Configure the database connection details.

Once created, the connector becomes available to all members of the project.

## Configuring Connection Details

When creating the connector, you will be asked to provide:

* **Connection string**

After the initial connection is successfully established, you can further refine how the database is exposed to the LLM.

---

## Advanced Database Configuration

After the database connection is established, you can configure advanced parameters:

### Tables and Schemas

* Limit access to **specific tables** or **schemas**
* Expose only the data that is relevant to your use case

This improves performance, security, and response accuracy.

### Description

You can define a **database description** that explains:

* What the database contains
* How the data should be interpreted
* Any domain-specific context

This description is used by the LLM to better understand how to query and reason over your data.

## Using a Database Connector in Chat

Once created, database connectors can be used in chats:

1. Open a chat inside the project.
2. Use the **Connectors** selector in the chat input.
3. Select the database connector you want to use.

The LLM will now be able to query the connected database during the conversation.

## Pre‑selecting Connectors for All Chats

Database connectors can be configured to be **pre‑selected by default** for all chats in a project.

This is especially useful when:

* Technical administrators configure the environment
* Non‑technical users interact with chats without manual setup

Once enabled, every new chat in the project will automatically have access to the connector.

---

## Personal or Private Databases

If you want to use a personal database that should not be shared:

1. Create a **private project**.
2. Add the database connector to that project.
3. Use it only within that private space.

The setup process is identical, but access is restricted to you alone.
