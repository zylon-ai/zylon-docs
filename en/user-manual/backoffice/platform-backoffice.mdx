## Overview
The Platform Backoffice allows Operators to:

- Create and manage accounts
- Assign roles
- Manage gateways
- Monitor platform service status

Only users with **Operator** permissions can access this section. Permissions and visibility depend on the current license.

## Accounts
In the **Accounts** section, Operators can:

- Create new accounts
- Assign roles and permissions
- Associate accounts with specific workspaces or gateways
- Modify existing accounts

### Roles and permissions
Account access is defined by role. The roles available in the account modal are:

- **Workspace** — Can access the Workspace.
- **Developer** — Can create and manage API tokens for development and integrations.
- **Operator** — Can manage user accounts and settings in the Backoffice.

The number of accounts is limited by the client's license. Account capabilities depend on assigned roles.

### Create an account
You can create a new user in two ways:

1. **From the modal:** Click **Add account**, enter the user details, assign roles, and save.

2. **From a CSV upload:** Download the template from the Accounts page, fill it with user data, and upload the CSV to create accounts in bulk.

To edit an account, select it from the list and update its roles or permissions.

## Gateways
A **Gateway** represents an isolated developer environment within Zylon. It is a software node (not a hardware device) used to audit API token usage and account activity across the Workspace.

Operators can:

- Create a new Gateway (only requires a name)
- Manage existing Gateways

The number of Gateways is limited by the active license.
