# MCP Connector

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Connector allows you to integrate external MCP servers into a **Project**, exposing their tools to the LLM in a controlled and shareable way.

> **Important change**: MCP connectors are no longer added directly inside chats. They are now **project-level shared connectors**.

---

## Creating an MCP Connector

To create an MCP connector:

1. Open your **Project**.
2. Click **Connectors** in the project sidebar.
3. Click **Create Connector**.
4. Select **MCP Server**.
5. Configure the MCP server connection.

Once created, the connector becomes available to all members of the project.

## Configuring the MCP Connection

When setting up the connector, you will provide:

* **MCP server name**
* **MCP endpoint URL**

After the connection is successfully established, you can control which MCP tools are exposed to the LLM.

---

## Selecting MCP Tools

Once the MCP connection has been established:

* A list of **available tools** provided by the MCP server is displayed
* You can **enable or disable** specific tools

This allows you to:

* Limit the LLM to only the tools it actually needs
* Reduce risk and unintended behavior
* Improve performance and reliability

Tool selection can be updated at any time after creation.

## Using an MCP Connector in Chat

After creation, MCP connectors can be used inside chats:

1. Open a chat within the project.
2. Use the **Connectors** selector in the chat input.
3. Select the MCP connector.

The LLM will now be able to call the enabled MCP tools during the conversation.

## Pre‑selecting MCP Connectors for All Chats

MCP connectors can be configured to be **enabled by default** for every chat in a project.

This is useful when:

* Platform or AI administrators manage integrations
* Non‑technical users should not worry about tool setup

Once enabled, every new chat in the project automatically has access to the MCP tools.

---

## Personal or Private MCP Servers

If you want to connect to a personal MCP server that should not be shared with others:

1. Create a **private project**.
2. Add the MCP connector to that project.
3. Configure tools as usual.

The same workflow applies, but access is limited to you only.
