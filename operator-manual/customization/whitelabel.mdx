### Whitelabel Zylon Agent

Zylon has whitelabel support, so you can now customize the AI assistant name to match your company branding.

By default, the assistant’s name is set to **Zylon**. To change it, simply update the `assistantName` field in your configuration file with your preferred name.

**Naming Guidelines**

- Keep your agent’s name under 20 characters.
- Avoid using mixed casing (e.g., “MyAIAssistant”).
- Do not include unusual symbols, special characters, or excessive punctuation (for example, “\$uper_Bot\!”).

```
assistantName: "Daisy"
```
