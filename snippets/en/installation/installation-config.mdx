Zylon is configured using a YAML file located at `/etc/zylon/zylon-conf.yaml`.

**Generate Initial Configuration**

Use the CLI to generate an initial configuration file:
```bash
sudo zylon-cli config init
```

This opens an interactive prompt to guide you through configuration options.

<Info>
If for any reason you got stuck during the interactive prompt, you can skip it by adding the `-y` flag to auto-generate a default configuration:
```bash
sudo zylon-cli config init -y
```
You will need to manually edit `/etc/zylon/zylon-conf.yaml` afterward to set your desired configuration based on the [manual configuration](#manual-configuration) section.
