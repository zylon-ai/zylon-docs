## n8n Integration

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a workflow automation tool now integrated into Zylon, enabling you to create flows by connecting different services and systems. The deployment and configuration of n8n are automatically managed by Zylon, requiring minimal user setup.

### Important Considerations
- **Version management**: Zylon manages the deployed n8n version to ensure compatibility with the rest of the system. Manual n8n updates are not available.
- **Access**: n8n is available at the `/n8n` path of your Zylon instance (for example: `https://your-zylon-instance.com/n8n`)
- **User management**: User management in n8n is independent from Zylon users. Users must be created and managed directly within the n8n interface.

### Configuration

To enable n8n in your environment, you only need to modify the corresponding option in the `/etc/zylon/zylon-conf.yaml` file:

```yaml
n8n:
  enabled: true  # Set to false to disable n8n
  publicApi:
    enabled: false  # Enable n8n's public REST API
  externalConnection:
    enabled: false  # Allow outbound connections to n8n services
```

<Info>
n8n's public API allows you to manage workflows, executions, credentials, 
and other resources programmatically through REST endpoints ([API Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/api/))
</Info>

<Warning>
In airgap mode, `externalConnection.enabled` will always be `false` regardless of the configured value.
</Warning>

### External Connections

When external connections are disabled, certain n8n functionalities are automatically deactivated:

- **Community packages**: Installation of packages from the NPM registry is disabled
- **Workflow templates**: Community workflow templates are disabled
- **License activation**: Licenses are not validated and will not work in this mode

These restrictions ensure that n8n operates without external dependencies.

### Proxy Configuration

n8n uses Zylon's global proxy configuration. The system automatically manages proxy certificates and endpoints, so no additional n8n-specific configuration is required.

If your organization uses a proxy, configure it following the [proxy configuration guide](/en/operator-manual/proxy).

## Backup Management

n8n uses PostgreSQL as its database, which means all n8n information is automatically included in Zylon's standard database backups. For more information about backup management, see the [Zylon backup documentation](/en/operator-manual/backup).
For specific use cases involving workflow migration or transfer between environments, see the [Workflow Import and Export](#workflow-import-and-export) section.

## Apply Configuration

After modifying the configuration file, apply the changes:

```bash
sudo zylon-cli sync
```

## Workflow Import and Export

n8n provides CLI commands that allow selective export and import of entities. These commands are especially useful for:

- **Migration from other environments**: If you want to migrate n8n information to Zylon from another existing environment
- **Selective import**: Export specific workflows from other environments and import them into Zylon without needing to migrate the entire instance

### Export Commands

**Export all workflows:**
```bash
n8n export:workflow --all --output=/home/node/.n8n/workflows.json
```

**Export a specific workflow:**
```bash
n8n export:workflow --id=42 --output=/home/node/.n8n/workflow-42.json
```

**Export credentials:**
```bash
n8n export:credentials --all --output=/home/node/.n8n/credentials.json
```

**Export decrypted credentials:**
```bash
n8n export:credentials --all --output=/home/node/.n8n/credentials.json --decrypted
```

<Tip>
Use the `--decrypted` option when migrating between instances with different encryption keys.
</Tip>

**Export complete instance:**
```bash
n8n export:workflow --all --backup --output=/home/node/.n8n/backup.json
```

### Import Commands

**Import workflows:**
```bash
n8n import:workflow --input=/home/node/.n8n/workflows.json
```

**Import a specific workflow:**
```bash
n8n import:workflow --input=/home/node/.n8n/workflow-42.json
```

**Import credentials:**
```bash
n8n import:credentials --input=/home/node/.n8n/credentials.json
```

### Transfer Files from Your Local Machine

If you need to import workflows or credentials from JSON files located on your local machine, you must first transfer them to the n8n pod:

#### 1. Get the Persistent Volume ID

```bash
# Get the n8n Persistent Volume ID
N8N_PV_ID=$(kubectl get pvc zylon-n8n-data -o jsonpath='{.spec.volumeName}' -n zylon)

# Build the directory path
N8N_PV_DIR="/var/zylon/data/$N8N_PV_ID"

# View the result
echo $N8N_PV_DIR
```

#### 2. Copy Files to the Volume

```bash
# Copy file from your local machine
sudo cp /local/path/workflows.json $N8N_PV_DIR/
```

#### 3. Access the Pod and Verify the File

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/zylon-n8n -n zylon -- /bin/sh
# Inside the pod, verify the file is available
ls /home/node/.n8n/
```

### Important Notes

<Warning>
Exported entities retain their original IDs, so importing them will overwrite existing entities with the same ID.
</Warning>

<Warning>
Export files must be located in an accessible directory within the pod, typically `/home/node/.n8n/`.
</Warning>
