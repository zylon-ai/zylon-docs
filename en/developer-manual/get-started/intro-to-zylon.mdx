Zylon is built for developers who need to ship AI features inside secure, self‑hosted environments. The platform exposes **two APIs**:

- **ZylonGPT API**: the AI layer for model responses, tools, and content-aware chat.
- **Workspace API**: the control plane for organizations, users, projects, and integrations.

Before you begin, generate an API token in [Token Management](/en/api-reference/token-management).
