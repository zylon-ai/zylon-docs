The Zylon Backoffice is the centralized administration environment for managing the Zylon platform. It operates outside of Workspaces and is used to manage:

- Accounts
- Roles and permissions
- Gateways
- API Tokens
- Platform service status

It is intended for users with:

- **Developer** permissions
- **Operator** permissions

Access requires a valid account with the appropriate role. The Backoffice is separate from the Workspace environment.
