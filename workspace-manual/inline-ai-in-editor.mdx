Select text in a flow document or type '/' to invoke AI. Use it to **improve format**, **rewrite**, or **generate** content. You can choose whether the AI should **use the project’s knowledge base** or answer generically.

- Example: “Improve the format” (don’t use Knowledge Base).
- Example: “Insert more details around our Android app requirements” (use Knowledege Base to retrieve the customer support docs and insert the facts).
