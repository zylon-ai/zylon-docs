When starting a chat in a project, choose:

- **Personal** — private to you (shows a lock icon).
- **Collaborative** — visible to all project members; teammates can reply and continue the thread.

You can **convert a private chat to collaborative** later. This action **cannot be undone**. Collaborative chats are discoverable via **Search** by members who have access to the project.
