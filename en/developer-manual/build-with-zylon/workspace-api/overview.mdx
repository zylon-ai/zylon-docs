description: "Control plane for automating Zylon Workspace."
---

The Workspace API is the control plane for **everything that happens in Zylon Workspace**—organizations, users, projects, chats, artifacts, integrations, and reporting. Use it when you need to automate admin workflows or integrate Zylon into your internal systems.

## Base URL

All Workspace endpoints live under:

```
https://{BASE_URL}/v1
```

## Core concepts

{/* <!-- RESTRUCTURED --> */}
| Concept | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Account** | The identity record that authenticates into Zylon. One account can belong to multiple organizations. |
| **User** | The org-specific representation of an account. An account can have **multiple users**, one per organization. |
| **Artifact** | A persisted piece of knowledge that can be retrieved in chats and tools. |

This model supports multi‑org setups where the same person can be a member of multiple workspaces with different roles.

## Pagination

Pagination is a shared model across the Workspace API. List endpoints return a page envelope with cursors:

{/* <!-- RESTRUCTURED --> */}
<Accordion title="Pagination envelope example">
```json
{
  "data": [],
  "next_cursor": "cursor_next",
  "previous_cursor": "cursor_prev",
  "has_next_page": false,
  "has_previous_page": false,
  "total_count": 0
}
```
</Accordion>

Use `page`, `page_size`, `after`, `before`, `first`, `last`, and `total_count` when they’re available on the endpoint.
