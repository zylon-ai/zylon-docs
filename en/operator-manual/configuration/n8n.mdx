<Tip>
n8n support is available starting from Zylon 1.53

## n8n Integration

n8n is a workflow automation tool that is now integrated into Zylon, allowing you to create automated flows that connect different services and systems.  
The deployment and configuration of n8n are handled automatically by Zylon, requiring minimal configuration from the user.

### Configuration

To enable n8n in your environment, you only need to enable or disable the corresponding option in your Zylon installation by editing  
the `/etc/zylon/zylon-conf.yaml` file:

```yaml
n8n:
  enabled: true  # Set to false to disable n8n
```

### Proxy Configuration

n8n uses Zylon’s global proxy configuration. The system automatically manages proxy certificates and endpoints,  
so no additional n8n‑specific proxy configuration is required.

If your organization uses a proxy, configure it following the [proxy configuration guide](/en/operator-manual/proxy).

### Air-Gapped Environments

When running Zylon in air-gapped environments (without internet access), certain n8n features are automatically disabled:

- **Community packages**: Installing packages from the NPM registry is disabled
- **Workflow templates**: Community workflow templates are disabled
- **License activation**: License activation is disabled

These restrictions ensure that n8n operates reliably without external dependencies.

## Backup Management

n8n uses PostgreSQL as its database, which means all n8n data is automatically included in Zylon’s standard database backups.

### CLI Commands for Export and Import

n8n provides CLI commands that allow selective export and import of entities, which is useful for specific migration cases or transferring workflows between environments:

**Export workflows:**
```bash
n8n export:workflow --backup
```

**Import workflows:**
```bash
n8n import:workflow --input=./workflow-file.json
```

**Export credentials:**
```bash
n8n export:credentials --output=./credentials.json
```

**Import credentials:**
```bash
n8n import:credentials --input=./credentials.json
```

**Export full instance:**
```bash
n8n export:entities --outputDir=./outputs
```

**Import full instance:**
```bash
n8n import:entities --inputDir=./outputs
```

### Use Cases

These commands are especially useful in the following scenarios:

- **Migration from other environments**: If a customer has workflows configured in another n8n instance and wants to migrate them to Zylon, they can export them with `export:entities` and import them with `import:entities`
- **Selective import**: Export specific workflows from other environments and import them into Zylon without needing to migrate the entire instance

### Important Notes

<Warning>
Exported entities keep their original IDs, so importing them will overwrite existing entities with the same ID.
</Warning>

For credentials, use the `--decrypted` option to export them in plain text, which is useful when migrating between instances with different encryption keys:

```bash
n8n export:credentials --output=./credentials.json --decrypted
```

For more information about CLI commands, see the [official n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/).

## Apply Configuration

After modifying the configuration file, apply the changes:

```bash
sudo zylon-cli sync
```

If your cluster was already running, restart the services:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart k0scontroller
# Wait a few seconds for the cluster to restart
kubectl delete pods -n zylon --all

```
