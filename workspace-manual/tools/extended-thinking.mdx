title: Extended thinking
description: Enable deeper, step‑by‑step reasoning for richer answers.

Turn on **Extended thinking** when you want the model to **reflect before answering**. You’ll see a “thinking” trace as it plans and critiques its own approach.

- Good for open prompts (drafting emails, planning, multi‑criteria decisions).
- Particularly helpful for **math/quant** reasoning.
- Can be combined with other tools like **Numeric analysis**.

> Extended thinking can take longer than a direct answer because it performs deliberate planning first.
