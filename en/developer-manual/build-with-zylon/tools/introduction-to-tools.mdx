Tools let the assistant run targeted operations (like searching artifacts, analyzing tabular data, or extracting a web page) as part of a message response.

You enable tools by adding three fields to a `POST /messages` request:

{/* <!-- RESTRUCTURED --> */}
| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tools` | Which tools are allowed. |
| `tool_choice` | How the assistant should choose tools (`auto`, force a specific tool, or `none`). |
| `tool_context` | Optional context artifacts (documents or database connections). |

## Prerequisites

- An API token. See [Token Management](/en/api-reference/token-management).
- Your Zylon hostname (replace `{BASE_URL}` in the examples).

## Basic request and response

When you’re iterating on tool configuration, start with `POST /messages/validate` to validate your request body without running a model.

This example enables the **web fetch** tool:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://{BASE_URL}/api/gpt/v1/messages/validate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "default",
    "max_tokens": 64,
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Summarize: https://example.com/" }
    ],
    "tools": [
      { "name": "web_extract", "type": "web_extract_v1" }
    ],
    "tool_choice": { "type": "auto" }
  }'
```

{/* <!-- RESTRUCTURED --> */}
<Accordion title="Example response">
```json
{ "valid": true, "errors": null }
```
</Accordion>

To actually run the request, send the same body to `POST /messages`.

## Built-in tools

Zylon includes a set of built-in tools you can enable by name + type:

| Tool type | What it does | Requires `tool_context` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `semantic_search_v1` | Search ingested artifacts | Yes (`ingested_artifact`) |
| `tabular_analysis_v1` | Analyze tabular artifacts | Yes (`ingested_artifact`) |
| `web_extract_v1` | Fetch and extract a URL mentioned in the message | No |
| `web_search_v1` | Search the web from a natural language query | No |
| `database_query_v1` | Query a SQL database from natural language | Yes (`sql_database`) |

- [Database Query tool](/en/developer-manual/build-with-zylon/tools/built-in/database-query-tool)

## Custom tools

Custom tools let you define your own tool interface using JSON Schema. When the assistant chooses your tool, it returns a `tool_use` content block with structured `input`.

See: [Custom tools](/en/developer-manual/build-with-zylon/tools/custom/custom-tools)

## Common mistakes

- **Using the wrong field name**: tool schemas use `inputSchema` (not `input_schema`).
- **Missing tool context**: `semantic_search_v1`, `tabular_analysis_v1`, and `database_query_v1` need `tool_context`.
- **Forgetting auth**: include `Authorization: Bearer ...` on every request.
