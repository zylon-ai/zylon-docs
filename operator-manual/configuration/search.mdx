To get a better experience during search it's recommended to enable what are the languages you plan to use in Zylon for content (Chats, documents, Agent Flows), the default language is `english` but multiple languages can be enabled.

```yaml
languages:
  keywordSearch: ['en', 'es', 'de']
```


The list of available languages is the following:
