## Common Issues

### Engine Fails to Start with Memory Error

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify your actual GPU memory**
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

2. **Try the next lower preset**
   ```yaml
   # If using baseline-32g, try baseline-24g instead
   ai:
     preset: "baseline-24g"
   ```

3. **Remove optional capabilities to reduce memory usage**
   ```yaml
   # Remove capabilities
   ai:
     preset: "baseline-24g"  # Instead of "baseline-24g,capabilities.multilingual"
   ```

4. **Check for other applications using GPU memory**

5. **Reboot the machine**

### Poor Performance or Slow Responses

**Solutions:**

1. **Ensure you're using the correct preset for your hardware**

2. **Consider decreasing to a lower-tier preset**

3. **Communicate with Zylon engineers to understand what is happening**

### Pod in Failed or CrashLoopBackOff State

If the Triton or inference pods are stuck in a failed state:

```bash
# Restart the deployment
kubectl rollout restart deploy/zylon-triton -n zylon
```

This forces Kubernetes to recreate the pods with a fresh state.

## Advanced Issues

Issues specific to custom model configurations and multi-model setups.

### Startup Failures

#### Triton Inference Server Fails to Start

**Solutions:**

1. **Check the Triton logs to identify which specific model is causing the failure**
   ```bash
   kubectl logs deploy/zylon-triton -n zylon --tail=200
   ```

2. **Verify memory allocation for the problematic model** - adjust `gpuMemoryUtilization` if needed

3. **If you've reduced memory allocation too much, reduce the `contextWindow` parameter for that model**

4. **Use `nvidia-smi` to check actual GPU memory usage and availability**
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

#### Unsupported Model Version

**Symptom**: Triton fails to load a model even though the model family is supported.

**Cause**: VLLM (the inference backend) may not support the specific version of your model yet. For example:
- Mistral Small 3 (2501) is supported
- Mistral Small 3 (2509) might not be supported yet

**Solutions:**

1. **Check the supported model version** in the documentation

2. **Try an earlier version** of the same model family if available

3. **Check Zylon release notes** for supported model versions

4. **Contact Zylon engineers** to confirm model compatibility

### Memory Errors

#### Engine Fails to Start with "Out of Memory" Error

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify total `gpuMemoryUtilization` does not exceed 0.95**
   ```yaml
   # Calculate total across all models
   ai:
     config:
       models:
         - id: llm
           gpuMemoryUtilization: 0.60
         - id: llmvision
           gpuMemoryUtilization: 0.25
         - id: embed
           gpuMemoryUtilization: 0.10
   # Total: 0.95 ✓
   ```

2. **Reduce allocation for one or more models based on the crash logs**
   ```bash
   kubectl logs deploy/zylon-triton -n zylon
   ```

3. **Check actual GPU memory with `nvidia-smi`** during startup
   ```bash
   watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
   ```
