title: Using tools — overview
description: Tools extend the chat agent for deeper reasoning and data analysis.

The chat can use tools to improve quality and handle data tasks:

- **Extended thinking** — lets the model think before answering; useful for open‑ended or multi‑step problems.
- **Numeric analysis** — run SQL‑like queries and charting against a **single CSV** from your knowledge base.
- **URL fetch** — paste a web **URL** and the assistant will fetch and use that page’s content for the response.

> You can enable **multiple tools together** (e.g., Extended thinking + Numeric analysis) when appropriate.
