Zylon supports three installation modes to accommodate different network environments. Choose the one that best fits your security and connectivity requirements.

| Feature | Online | Semi-Airgap | Airgap |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Internet Access | Full | Limited | None on target |
| Setup Complexity | Simple | Moderate | Complex |
| Security Level | Standard | High | Maximum |
| Update Process | Simple | Required manual work | Pseudo-manual |
| Proxy Support | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Installation Time | ~30-90 min | ~1-2 hours | ~2-3 hours |
| Update Time | ~15-40 min | ~30-60 min | ~1-2 hours |
| Requires downtime for updates | Not common, or minutes | Not common, or minutes | Always, 15-60 min |

### Understanding better the Installation Modes

#### Online Installation
The Zylon server has full, unrestricted access to the internet. It can download packages, container images, and updates directly from official repositories and registries.

- **Setup Complexity**: Straightforward installation using a single command. The installer automatically downloads and configures all required components. Minimal technical expertise required.
- **Security Level**: Standard security appropriate for most business environments. The server can communicate outbound to download updates and access external services.
- **Update Process**: Fully automated. Run a single update command and the system downloads and applies all updates automatically. Can be scheduled using cron jobs for hands-off maintenance.
- **Proxy Support**: Supported if needed
- **Installation Time**: ~30-90 minutes depending on your network speed and hardware
- **Update Time**: ~15-40 minutes. Downtime is not common, or just a few minutes when required.

#### Semi-Airgap Installation
The server has limited or controlled internet access, typically through a proxy or firewall with whitelisted domains.

- **Setup Complexity**: Moderate. Requires network configuration (proxy settings, firewall rules). You'll need to coordinate with your network security team to whitelist specific domains and ports.
- **Security Level**: Enhanced security through network isolation and controlled access points. Reduces exposure to internet-based threats while maintaining update capabilities through controlled channels.
- **Update Process**: Updates require manual intervention to download update packages on a connected machine, and then apply them. Coordination with network security teams may be needed for installing/updating.
- **Proxy Support**: Supported and typically required
- **Installation Time**: ~1-2 hours including network configuration
- **Update Time**: ~30-60 minutes. Downtime is not common, or just a few minutes when required.

#### Airgap Installation
The target server has no internet connection whatsoever. All installation files, container images, and dependencies must be transferred from a connected machine to the isolated target server using offline media (USB drives, internal network transfers, etc.).

- **Setup Complexity**: Most complex setup requiring a staging machine with internet access, manual transfer of large installation bundles (70-100 GB), and careful coordination between the connected and isolated environments.
- **Security Level**: Highest security posture for sensitive environments (government, defense, healthcare, finance). Complete isolation from external networks eliminates internet-based attack vectors entirely. Ideal for compliance with strict security frameworks (NIST, FedRAMP, classified environments).
- **Update Process**: Pseudo-manual process requiring the use of a connected machine to download update bundles, transfer them offline to the target server, and apply them through the CLI. Plan for 1-2 hour maintenance windows for major updates. This will often cause downtime for Zylon services during the update process.
- **Proxy Support**: Not applicable (no internet connection)
- **Installation Time**: ~2-3 hours including file transfers
- **Update Time**: ~1-2 hours. Always requires 15-60 minutes of downtime.

## Prerequisites

For a smooth sailing make sure you pass this checklist before you begin the installation:

- The target machine is clean of any other software that can interfere with it. That means no docker, no kubernetes, http servers, no Nvidia drivers, etc.
- You have root and SSH access to the machine
- The machine has stable and strong Internet connection
- You can reboot the machine if needed
- Your firewall is not blocking connections to any website.
  - In case you run in a restricted environment, check the [semi-airgap instructions](/en/operator-manual/semi-airgap)
- The machine has `curl` installed
- You have a domain for Zylon ready (ex: zylon.your-company.com)
  - If your instance is not open to the internet  you have a valid SSL certificate for that domain, it will be needed as the last step of the installation.

Once you have fulfilled the hardware requirements and have a domain ready it is time to install Zylon!

For single instance setups Zylon it’s installed using it’s CLI `zylon-cli` on the machine where you want to run it. To start the install process make sure that:

- At install time, the machine has internet connection (After Zylon has been installed internet connection it is not a requirement)
- You have ssh access to the machine
- Firewall rules will not block the CLI to download any Zylon container images or certificate generation
