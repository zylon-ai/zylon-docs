ZylonGPT gives you a single API surface for building chat experiences that can **use tools** and **work with ingested content**.

This developer manual is organized around the core building blocks:

- **Messages**: send a conversation history, get back an assistant message.
- **Artifacts**: ingest text/files/URIs into collections so you can retrieve and use them later.
- **Tools**: run built-in capabilities like semantic search, tabular analysis, and web fetch.
