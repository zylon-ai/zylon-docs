## Installating Zylon (Online)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Zylon CLI">
    _Estimated time: 2 min_

    <InstallationCli />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Zylon minimum requirements">
    Ensure your machine meets the [hardware requirements](/en/operator-manual/hardware-requirements) for Zylon.

    To validate automatically if your installation meets the minimum requirements, run:

    ```bash
    sudo zylon-cli preflight-checks --network --fresh-system -v
    ```

    Address any issues reported before proceeding with the installation. You will not be able to continue until all preflight checks pass.
    <Info>
      Are you having issues with network connectivity? Considering move to a [Semi-Airgap Installation](/en/operator-manual/installation/semi-airgap) or [Airgap Installation](/en/operator-manual/installation/airgap).
    </Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Zylon">
    _Estimated time: 10min_

    <InstallationConfig />

    **For proxy environments**, see the [Proxy Configuration Guide](/en/operator-manual/configuration/network/proxy).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Zylon">
    _Estimated time: 15min to 1hour, depending on system performance and network speed._

    Run the installation command with your desired version:

    ```bash
    sudo zylon-cli list-versions
    # Choose your desired version from the list
    sudo zylon-cli install <version>
    ```

    Replace `<version>` with your target version (e.g., `1.50.0`).

    **What Gets Installed**

    The installation process handles:

    - System dependencies (gcc, git, etc.)
    - Kubernetes distribution ([k0s](https://k0sproject.io/))
    - NVIDIA drivers and CUDA (if applicable)
    - Container runtime and tools (kubectl, helm)
    - Zylon container images
    - AI models from your configuration
    - SSL certificate generation (if using Let's Encrypt)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Organization">
    _Estimated time: 5 min_

    <InstallationSeed />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure SSL (Optional)">
    _Estimated time: 10 min_

    <Info>
      **Skip this step** if using Let's Encrypt automatic certificates (default for public-facing instances).
    </Info>

    For VPN or private cloud deployments, you need to manually install SSL certificates.

## Updating Zylon (Online)

Updates follow the same process as installation:

```bash
sudo zylon-cli list-versions
# Choose your desired version from the list
sudo zylon-cli install <new-version>
```

Additionally, you can upgrade directly to the latest version using the upgrade command:

```bash
sudo zylon-cli upgrade
```
