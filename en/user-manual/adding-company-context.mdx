Adding relevant company context **is a quick and effective way to customize your company's Private AI**. Include information about the company: what it does, the general purpose of the company's AI and any other relevant information like acronyms or company-specific terms. 
The **AI will take that context into account in every interaction across every project**. 

## Where to find it
Click on the  **Workspace name** in the top left, and select **Company Context**.

## What not to use it for
Changing the **assistant name** or other instance-level settings is **not done** here. That is a **platform/instance configuration** task. Refer to your Zylon administrator or review the Operations Manual.
