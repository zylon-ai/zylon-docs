To **reuse** content from the Knowledge Base of another project **without duplicating** it:

1. In **Upload files**, choose **Link from another project**.
2. Select the **source project**, then link either its **entire Knowledge Base** or specific **folders**.
3. Linked content is **available immediately** (no re‑ingestion).

**Updates propagate** from the original project automatically—linked folders/files stay in sync with their source.

> **Tip:** Use folders to scope chats. When you start a chat you can target the **entire Knowledge Base** or a **specific folder** to improve accuracy.
