title: Confluence connector
description: Import folders and files from Confluence and keep them in sync on demand.
---


You can import **Spaces** from Confluence that you have access to. After importing, use the **Update** buttom (within the 3 dots menu) to **sync** with the source:

- Detects **content changes** in files.
- Adds **new files** and **removes** deleted ones.
- Reflects **moves/renames** so the structure mirrors Confluence Space.

> Everyone with access to the Project will have access to the files and folders you connect to the project, independently of the original permissions in Confluence.
