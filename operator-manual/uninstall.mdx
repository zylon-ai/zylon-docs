If you feel like something went wrong with your installation you can uninstall Zylon easily.

Be aware that doing so will WIPE ALL YOUR DATA, including users, uploaded documents and so forth. This step cannot be reverted.

Run the following command to uninstall zylon.

```bash
helm uninstall -n zylon zylon
```
