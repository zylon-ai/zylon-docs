Edit `/etc/zylon/zylon-conf.yaml` to adjust settings as needed.

**Define your OS distribution**

Set `node.distro` to match your Ubuntu version:

```yaml
node:
  distro: "ubuntu22"  # for Ubuntu 22.04
  # distro: "ubuntu24"  # for Ubuntu 24.04
```

**Define your CPU architecture**

Set `node.arch` to match your hardware:

```yaml
node:
  arch: "amd64"  # for Intel/AMD processors
```

**Set your hardware drivers (if applicable)**

Set `node.drivers` to `generic` (this is the only supported option):

```yaml
node:
  drivers: "generic"
```

**Configure cluster type**

Set `cluster.type` to `k0s` (this is the only supported option for single instance installations):

```yaml
cluster:
  type: "k0s"
```

**Select your release channel**

Set `channel` to `stable` (recommended for production and normal use) or `unstable` (available under request for testing):

```yaml
channel: "stable"
```

**Add your license information**

Set `license.email` to the email address assigned to your license (provided during registration).

Set `license.id` to the license ID shared with you by the Zylon team via email:

```yaml
license:
  email: "champion@company.com"
  id: "2oq..."
```

**Choose your AI preset**

Set `ai.preset` based on your available GPU memory. See [AI Presets](/en/operator-manual/ai-presets/getting-started) for details.

```yaml
ai:
  preset: "baseline-24g"
```

**Set your company identifier**

Set `companyIdentifier` to any identifier for anonymous metrics tracking (e.g., `acme-corp`). If you have multiple installations, use different identifiers (e.g., `company` and `company-test`):

```yaml
companyIdentifier: "your-company"
```

**Disable telemetry & crash reporting**

To disable telemetry and crash reporting, add the following section:

```yaml
observability:
    crashReporting: false
    usageMetrics: false
```

**Configure network ingress**

Set `ingress.host` to the domain you've prepared for Zylon. This should be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that points to your server's IP address.

Examples:
- `zylon.company.com`
- `ai.acme-corp.com`
- `zylon-prod.yourcompany.io`

```yaml
ingress:
  host: "zylon.your-company.com"
  enabled: true
  tlsEnabled: true
```

**Configure SSL certificate generation**

If your server is accessible from the internet, Let's Encrypt will automatically generate and renew SSL certificates. Keep the default `certManagerAnnotations`:

```yaml
ingress:
  certManagerAnnotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
```

If you're in a private network or need to use a custom certificate, see [Disable Let's Encrypt](#disable-lets-encrypt) below.
