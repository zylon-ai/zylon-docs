Use the Search API to query workspace content with a single text query. Limit search scope with the `type` filter.

## Basic request and response

Search across resources with `GET /v1/app/search`.

```bash
curl "https://{BASE_URL}/v1/app/search?q=support%20summary&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}"
```

<Accordion title="Example response">
```json
[
  {
    "id": "artifact_2b4d6f8a1c3e5a7b",
    "type": "Artifact",
    "match": "Q1 Support Summary",
    "rank": 0.91,
    "metadata": {
      "name": "Q1 Support Summary",
      "type": "Document",
      "project_id": "proj_7a5c3e1b9d2f4a6c",
      "project_name": "Customer Insights"
    }
  }
]
```
</Accordion>

## Search only threads

```bash
curl "https://{BASE_URL}/v1/app/search?q=weekly%20brief&type=Thread&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}"
```

<Accordion title="Example response">

[
  {
    "id": "thread_3f2a1c4d5b6e7f8a",
    "type": "Thread",
    "match": "Weekly Support Brief",
    "rank": 0.86,
    "metadata": {
      "name": "Weekly Support Brief",
      "project_id": "proj_7a5c3e1b9d2f4a6c",
