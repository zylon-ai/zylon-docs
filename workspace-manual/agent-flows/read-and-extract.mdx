title: Read and extract
description: Define topics and extract all relevant passages across long documents, with citations.
---

For long, compliance‑sensitive or spec‑heavy documents (e.g., RFPs), define the **topics** to extract (e.g., *mobile app requirements*, *payment terms*, *entity names*) and point it to the set of documents to be analyzed. The flow works as follows:

1. **Reads the full document/s**.
2. **Highlights** relevant sentences per topic.
3. Produces a structured list with **exact quotes** and **citations** to the source locations.
4. Lets you **prune** or **post‑process** (e.g., “summarize into five points”).

> This is an advanced flow but extremely effective for structured reviews and downstream analysis.
