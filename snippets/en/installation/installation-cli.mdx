The Zylon CLI simplifies the installation process by handling driver installation, dependency management, and configuration generation.

SSH into your target machine and run:

```bash
sudo curl -sL get.zylon.ai | sh
```

To inspect the installation script before running:

```bash
curl -sL get.zylon.ai
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
sudo zylon-cli --help
```

<Note>
  Root access is required for CLI operations as it manages system-level dependencies and configurations.
