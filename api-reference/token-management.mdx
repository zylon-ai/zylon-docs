<Warning>
    Zylon APIs are under active development.
    While no major breaking changes are anticipated, minor adjustments may occur.
</Warning>

All request to Zylon APIs have to be authenticated, either by session cookies (for web access)
or by API tokens (for programmatic access). This document describes how to generate and use API tokens.

<Warning>
    API tokens generated by Zylon are currently limited to the super admin user, and therefore
    must be generated through the CLI by the system administrator.

    In a future release, all users will be able to generate their own tokens through the web interface.
</Warning>

To generate a token, run the following command in your Zylon instance:

```bash
sudo zylon-cli create-api-token
```

After a token is generated, it will only be displayed once and all previous tokens associated
to that user will be revoked.

Zylon allows multiple organizations to cohabit in the same installation, so
the organization name MUST also be provided when calling the API with `x-org: <org_slug>` as a header.
The default organization is called `default`.

To verify the token is working you can run the CURL command, it will display information about the calling account.
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" "x-org: default" https://<your_zylon_domain.com>/api/v1/account/me -H
```

<Tip>Keep your token secret, it provides full access to your Zylon installation!.</Tip>

### Access the workspace API (High-level API)

In order to access the workspace API, simply call the endpoints under `/api/v1/...`

Follow the API docs about the workspace API in the sidebar of this page for
the full reference of each endpoint.

### Low-level API (ZylonGPT)

To access the low-level API, the Workspace API must be used as a proxy for
authentication purposes.

The requests will be proxied under the url `<your_zylon_domain.com>/api/gpt/...`
For example, to generate a simple inference you can run the following command:

```bash
/gpt/v1/messages
curl -X POST https://<your_zylon_domain.com>/api/gpt/v1/messages \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
    -H "x-org: default" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about AI"}], "stream": false}'
```

Follow the API docs about the ZylonGPT API in the sidebar of this page for
the full reference.

<Tip>
    All request to the low-level API must be proxied through the workspace API,
    so all paths must start with `/api/gpt/...` followed by the actual ZylonGPT endpoint.
