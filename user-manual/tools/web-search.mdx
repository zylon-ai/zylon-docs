Enable **Web search** when you want Zylon to **look things up online** instead of relying only on what it already knows. When this is on, Zylon can **open webpages** and use information from the internet to craft an answer.

This is ideal for anything that changes often (new releases, pricing, regulations, product specs, benchmarks, current events, etc.).

## What you get

- **Up-to-date answers** based on live web content
- **Links and source references** so you can verify where information came from
- Better results for queries that require **fresh context** or **specific details** (dates, version numbers, policy changes)

## When to use it

- “What changed in X recently?”
- “What’s the latest version of Y and what are the breaking changes?”
- “Find official docs for Z and summarize the setup steps.”
- “Compare these products using current specs and pricing.”

## How it appears in chat

When Web search is enabled, you’ll see it available in the chat input (alongside other options like knowledge sources and connectors). Once enabled for the conversation, Zylon can search the web and include helpful sources in its response.

## Notes & best practices

- Prefer **specific prompts** (what you want compared, which region, which timeframe).
- Ask for **sources** when accuracy matters (“include links” / “cite your sources”).
- Web results can vary in quality—Zylon will prioritize reputable sources when possible, but you should still verify critical details.
