title: Confluence Server connector
description: Import pages from an on-premise Confluence Server / Data Center instance and keep them in sync on demand.
---

You can import **Spaces** from a **Confluence Server / Data Center** instance that you have access to.

After importing, use the **Update** button (within the 3-dots menu) to **sync** with the source:

- Detects **content changes** in pages.
- Adds **new pages** and **removes** deleted ones.
- Reflects **moves and renames**, keeping the structure in sync with the Confluence Space hierarchy.

Confluence Server does not use folders.
Instead, **pages and their child pages** are used to recreate the hierarchy.

> Everyone with access to the Project will have access to the pages you connect, independently of the original permissions in Confluence.
