title: "Observability"
---

In order to provide support in case something goes south, there are two main observability tools that are enabled:

- Sentry for crash reporting
- Grafana for anonymous and aggregated usage metrics

The data sent will help us to diagnose any malfunctioning in the platform and understand how Zylon is being used to expedite any support actions.

In case you want to opt out of this you can do so by adding the following snippet to the configuration file:

```yaml
observability:
  crashReporting: false
  usageMetrics: false
```

## Grafana

The following domain needs to be whitelisted:  `*.grafana.net`

For added granularity, the domains used are:

- Basic usage metrics (no private information sent)-\> [https://prometheus-prod-24-prod-eu-west-2.grafana.net](https://prometheus-prod-24-prod-eu-west-2.grafana.net/)
- Logs (no private information sent); [https://logs-prod-012.grafana.net](https://logs-prod-012.grafana.net/)
- System Traces (no private information sent): [https://tempo-prod-10-prod-eu-west-2.grafana.net](https://tempo-prod-10-prod-eu-west-2.grafana.net/)
