To integrate with confluence, you need to **create an Atlassian application** that will act as a bridge between Zylon ↔ Confluence and **configure Zylon** to use the brand new Atlassian application

## Create an Atlassian app

First you need an atlassian account that will be the owner of the application. We recommend to use a non personal account. This account does not need to have access to any Space as it will serve as a bridge between Zylon and Confluence.

1. Go to [https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/)

    Click `Create` → `OAuth 2.0 integration`

1. Provide a meaningful name for the Application.

    - In the left menu navigate to `Distribution`
    - Click on `Edit`

1. On distribution status:
- Select the `Sharing` checkbox.
- Enter a vendor name or choose the option `Use your own name`.
- If you have a privacy policy, provide the link to it. If not, use the default link: [`https://example.com/privacy`](https://example.com/privacy), which is intended for internal use.
- For the question "Does your app store personal data?", select `No`

1.  On permissions:
- In the left menu, navigate to **`Permissions`**.
- Click **`Add`** for **`Confluence API`**.
- The page refreshes automatically, and a new **`Configure`** button should appear. If it does not, refresh the page manually.
- Click **`Configure`**.

1. Add one by one the following permissions. You can search them pasting the values into the field with a magnifying glass.

    There needs to be a total of `10` scopes added that you can review before saving.


```bash
        read:content:confluence,
        read:content-details:confluence,
        read:space-details:confluence,
        read:page:confluence,
        read:attachment:confluence,
        read:blogpost:confluence,
        read:custom-content:confluence,
        read:space:confluence,
        read:space.permission:confluence,
        read:folder:confluence,

```

1. On authorization:
- In the left menu, navigate to **`Authorization`**.
- Click **`Add`** for **`OAuth 2.0 (3LO)`**.

1. In authorization:
- In the **`Callback URL`** field, enter:
`https://zylon.company.com/api/app/integration/confluence/callback`Replace **`zylon.company.com`** with the hostname where Zylon is installed on your server.
- Click **`Save changes`**.

1. On settings:
- In the left menu, navigate to `Settings`. Copy the two values listed under **`Authentication details`**:
    - Client ID
    - Secret

You will need these values for the next step: [Configure Zylon to use Atlassian Application](https://www.notion.so/Configure-Zylon-to-use-Atlassian-Application-19e00531e9a78026896ae201cb7e2cf3?pvs=21)

## Configure Zylon to use Atlassian Application

With the values we have acquired in [step 10](https://www.notion.so/ARCHIVED-Confluence-integration-doc-19d00531e9a7809baad3f8131f968d12?pvs=21), you need to edit Zylon config file located in `/etc/zylon/zylon-conf.yaml`

<Tip>
    The config file is a `.yaml` file mind indentation, spaces, semicolons, double quotes!
</Tip>

Add the following snippet to the bottom of the file

```bash
integration:
  confluence:
    enabled: true
    clientId: ""
    clientSecret: ""
    redirectUri: ""  

```

And fill the properties with the values generated previously:

- clientId → value generated on [step 10](https://www.notion.so/ARCHIVED-Confluence-integration-doc-19d00531e9a7809baad3f8131f968d12?pvs=21)
- clientSecret → value generated on [step 10](https://www.notion.so/ARCHIVED-Confluence-integration-doc-19d00531e9a7809baad3f8131f968d12?pvs=21)
- redirectUri → same value as [step 9](https://www.notion.so/ARCHIVED-Confluence-integration-doc-19d00531e9a7809baad3f8131f968d12?pvs=21)

Save and close `/etc/zylon/zylon-conf.yaml` file

Finally, execute the following command to reset Zylon and update the config

```bash
zylon-cli sync
```

You are all set 🎉

## Troubleshooting

### I try to upload files to the knowledge base and Confluence button is greyed out

Clear the browser cache and try again.

### When I click on `Upload files -> From Confluence` the log in is not working

- Check that the `clientId` `secretId` are copy pasted correctly into Zylon config file
- Check that the `Callback URL` is correct in [step 9](https://www.notion.so/ARCHIVED-Confluence-integration-doc-19d00531e9a7809baad3f8131f968d12?pvs=21) and it’s the same as the `redirectUri` in the config file.

### I don’t see any space to import

- Make sure you have logged in into Confluence with an account that has access to spaces.
- Check the permissions required are correct as shown in [step 6](https://www.notion.so/ARCHIVED-Confluence-integration-doc-19d00531e9a7809baad3f8131f968d12?pvs=21)
