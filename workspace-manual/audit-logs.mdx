The audit log “contains **every single thing that happens** in the platform”—what people do, what they ask, and what projects they create.

It can be exported via API and connected to common audit tools.

## Privacy
This tool is intended for certain industries that require a strong control of the use of internal information. If you **prefer not to enable** the audit log in your company, you can disable it at configuration level; check the Operator Manual or contact your administrator. 

<Callout type="tip">
Use Audit Logs when you need a precise trail of actions. If your policy requires no storage of activity, keep it disabled.
