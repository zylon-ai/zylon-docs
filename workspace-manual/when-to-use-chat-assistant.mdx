Use the chat for two patterns:

1. **Direct Q&A on your knowledge base** — when you know the answer should be in your project’s documents. Answers include **inline citations** to exact source passages.
2. **Open‑ended “thought partner” work** — enable **Extended thinking** for deeper reasoning (e.g., drafting replies, planning meetings, or multi‑step tasks).

> You can **scope** a chat to the **entire Knownledge Base** or a **specific folder** or **file** to help the model focus.
