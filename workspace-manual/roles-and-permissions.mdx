Knowledge base permissions are governed by **project roles**:

- **Viewer** — can start chats and agent flows that *use* the Knowledge Base; **cannot** modify the Knowledge Base.
- **Editor** — can **add/remove** Knowledge Base content and structure.
- **Admin / Owner** — full control; can also **transfer ownership**.

> There are no separate “per-document roles—the project role determines what you can do with the project's Knowledge Base.
