title: Numeric analysis
description: Analyze a CSV from your knowledge base with natural‑language queries.
---

Use **Numeric analysis** to analyze a **single CSV** stored in your project’s knowledge base.

**How it works**
- You select the CSV file to analyze.
- You activate the **Numeric Analysis** tool.
- Your natural‑language prompt is translated into an **SQL query** and run against the CSV **as if it were a database**.
- Results are rendered as **tables or charts**.

**Tips**
- CSV must be **well‑formed** (single header row; no formulas or multiple sheets).
- Ask for **tables** or specific **charts** (bar, line, heat map, etc.).
- Be as explicit as possible regarding the **column names to be used**. The agent doesn't know your data structure.
- Keep queries grounded in the data present; **external drivers** aren’t inferred unless provided as documents or via a fetched URL in the same chat.

> You can use **Extended thinking + Numeric analysis** together for multi‑step analyses.
