The Zylon CLI will speed up the time it takes to get everything ready, it will take care of installing drivers, updating Zylon and configuring the system.
To install it, SSH into the machine where you want to install Zylon and run:

```bash
sudo curl -sL get.zylon.ai | sh
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
sudo zylon-cli version
```

<Note>
  Root access is required for CLI operations as it manages system-level dependencies and configurations.
