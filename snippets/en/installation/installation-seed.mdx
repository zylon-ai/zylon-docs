After Zylon is installed and running, create your organization and root administrator account.

**Prepare Information**

You'll need:

- **Organization name**: Your company or team name (can be changed later)
- **Admin password**: Secure password for root administrator (can be changed later)
  - Use alphanumeric characters due to encoding limitations with special symbols
- **Email regex**: Pattern to auto-allow users to join
  - For `name@company.com` emails, use: `.*@company\.com`
  - For SSO (Microsoft Entra, Google), you can use: `.*`

**Run Seed Command**

```bash
sudo zylon-cli seed \
  --org-name "My Organization" \
  --admin-password "secure-password" \
  --email-regex ".*@yourcompany\.com"
```

The command will wait if Zylon is not fully ready.

<Danger>
  **Running the seed command will WIPE ALL DATA.** Only run this once during the initial Zylon setup.
</Danger>

**Login Credentials**

After seeding, use these credentials to log in:

```
Username: admin@zylon.ai
Password: [the password you set]
```

The root admin email is always `admin@zylon.ai` and cannot be changed.

<Note>
  After first login, you can create additional administrators and configure SSO authentication.
