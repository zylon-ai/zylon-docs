Complete these essential tasks to start using Zylon effectively. This guide takes about 15 minutes and covers everything you need to be productive.

## Step 1: Create Your First Project (3 minutes)

Projects organize your AI work by topic or team. Start with a simple personal project.

1. **Click "Create Project"** from your dashboard
2. **Name it descriptively** - e.g., "Personal Research" or "Customer Support"
3. **Keep it private** for now (you can share it later)

*[Screenshot placeholder: Project creation dialog showing name, description, and privacy settings]*

<Info>
Projects are private by default. Only you can see them unless you explicitly share them with others.

## Step 2: Connect Your Knowledge (5 minutes)

Add documents so Zylon can help you with your actual work. Navigate to the Knowledge Base section of your project.

**Option A: Upload Files**
1. **Drag and drop** 2-3 documents you work with regularly
2. **Wait for processing** (usually 2-5 minutes)
3. **Check the knowledge base** to confirm they're ready

**Option B: Connect to an external source, like SharePoint**
1. **Click "Connect SharePoint"** in your project
2. **Authenticate** with your credentials  
3. **Select a specific folder** (not the entire site)

*[Screenshot placeholder: Knowledge base section showing uploaded documents and connection options]*

**Supported file types:**
- PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets
- PowerPoint presentations, plain text files
- SharePoint folders, Confluence spaces

## Step 3: Ask Your First Question (3 minutes)

Now test Zylon with a real question about your documents.

1. **Start a new chat** (choose Personal for now)
2. **Ask a specific question** about the documents you uploaded
3. **Review the response** and click on the citations
4. **Ask a follow-up question** to see how Zylon maintains context

**Good example questions:**
```
"What are the key requirements mentioned in [document name]?"
"What's our policy on [specific topic]?"
```

## Step 4: Try an Agent Flow (4 minutes)

Agent Flows handle complex tasks automatically in the background.

1. **Go to Agent Flows** in your project
2. **Choose "Summarize a File"**
3. **Select one of your uploaded documents**
4. **Add instructions** like "Create an executive summary focusing on key decisions"
5. **Click Start** and let it run in the background

*[Screenshot placeholder: Agent Flow interface showing summarization options and progress]*

**Other Agent Flows to try:**
- **Answer in Bulk**: Upload a list of questions for automatic answers
- **Generate a Draft**: Create new documents from prompts
- **Read & Extract**: Pull specific information from multiple documents
