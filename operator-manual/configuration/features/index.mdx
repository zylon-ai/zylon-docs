Zylon supports feature toggling, allowing you to enable or disable certain features on demand. This is managed through the `features` field in your configuration file.

Each feature can define its own set of keys to control behavior.

```
features:
  audit:
    enabled: true
  database:
    enabled: true
  mcp:
    enabled: true
```
