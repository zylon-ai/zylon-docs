title: "Exporting Logs"
---

This guide helps you export accurate logs so customer support can resolve issues faster and with fewer back-and-forths. Because Zylon runs locally on your infrastructure and is often deployed in fully air-gapped environments, these logs are the safest and most reliable way for us to understand what happened without accessing your data directly. The steps are written for non-technical users and show the differences between Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

## Before you start

1. Open the Zylon app in your browser.
2. Go to the page where the problem happens.
3. Keep this tab open while you follow the steps below.

## Frontend logs (browser responses)

There are two ways to share frontend logs. You can send a full network HAR file, or you can share a single response from the request list.
A HAR (HTTP Archive) is a file that contains all network requests and responses for a page. This can speed up troubleshooting. If you want to share only a specific response, follow the single‑log steps below.

### Google Chrome

1. Open Developer Tools.
2. Press `F12` on Windows or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac.
3. Click the `Network` tab.
4. Check `Preserve log` so requests do not disappear when the page reloads.
5. Reproduce the problem (click the same buttons or run the same action).
6. To export a HAR: right‑click anywhere in the request list and choose `Save all as HAR with content`, then share the file with support.
6. In the list of requests, click the one that matches the action you just did.
7. In the right panel, open the `Response` tab.
8. Right-click inside the response and choose `Copy`.
9. Paste the response into a text file and share it with support.

If you cannot find the request, try these quick checks.

1. Make sure the `Network` tab is selected.
2. Reload the page and repeat the action.
3. Look for filters like `Fetch/XHR` and select them.

## Non-frontend logs (backend, AI, and other services)

Logs for non-frontend issues must be retrieved from the relevant pod instance (backend, AI services, or other components). Check your pods to find the correct service before collecting logs.
See the [system admin dashboard guide for pod status and service visibility](en/operator-manual/operations/sys-admin-dashboard.mdx)
