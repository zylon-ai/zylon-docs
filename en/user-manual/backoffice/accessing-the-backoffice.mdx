There are two ways to access the Backoffice. Both require **Developer** or **Operator** permissions.

1. **From a Workspace:** Open the left navigation menu and select **Platform Backoffice** or **Developer Tools**. These entries appear only if your account has the required permissions.

2. **From a direct URL:** Navigate to `https://<your_zylon_domain>/backoffice`. You will be redirected to the login screen. Sign in with your Zylon account credentials or an enabled SSO provider.

Once signed in, you can switch between **Platform Backoffice**, **Developer Tools**, and **Workspace**.
