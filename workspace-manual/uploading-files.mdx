description: Add knowledge to a project by uploading local files or importing from a connector.

Every project has its **own knowledge base**. You can populate it by:

- **Uploading files from your device.** Drag & drop or pick files. Local uploads are **static**—re‑upload if the source changes.
- **Importing via a connector (e.g., SharePoint).** You can select **files or entire folders** you have access to. Ingestion progress is shown.

> **Combine sources:** It’s fine to mix local uploads and connector imports in the same project.
