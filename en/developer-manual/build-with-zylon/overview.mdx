description: "The core building blocks for building with ZylonGPT: messages, artifacts, and tools."
---

Most ZylonGPT applications follow the same loop:

1. **Ingest knowledge** you want the assistant to use (Artifacts).
2. **Generate a response** (Messages).
3. **Retrieve or analyze** that knowledge (Tools).

This section focuses on the pieces you’ll combine to build real features.

## Messages

The Messages API is how you talk to the model: you send a conversation history, and you receive the next assistant message back as structured content blocks.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are how you persist context in Zylon (text, files, or URIs) inside a collection, so it can be retrieved and reused across requests.

## Tools

Tools let Zylon run targeted operations (like searching artifacts, analyzing tabular data, or extracting a web page) as part of a message response.
