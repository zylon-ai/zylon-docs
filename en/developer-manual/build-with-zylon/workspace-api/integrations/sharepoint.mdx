SharePoint integrations ingest libraries and documents into your workspace. **Enable SharePoint at the instance level first**—see the operator guide: [SharePoint integration setup](/en/operator-manual/knowledge-base/sharepoint).

If OAuth is required, use the login endpoints in [OpenID & OAuth](/en/developer-manual/build-with-zylon/workspace-api/authentication/openid).
