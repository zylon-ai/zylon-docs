Use the **Seach** tool to search **everything you have access to** in the workspace:

- **Projects** by name
- **Chats** (personal and collaborative you can access)
- **Agent flows** (e.g., summaries)
- **Files** (including uploads and connector imports)

**Open search:** Press **Cmd/Ctrl‑K** to bring up Search anywhere, then type to jump directly to results.

> Results respect permissions—you will only see content from projects you can access.
