description: "Fetch and extract a URL mentioned in the message."

Use Web Fetch when your user asks about a web page. You include the URL in the message, enable the tool, and the assistant can fetch and extract readable text from the page.

## Prerequisites

```bash
export API_TOKEN="YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

If you don’t have a token yet, see [Token Management](/en/api-reference/token-management).

## Requirements

- Tool spec: `{ "name": "web_extract", "type": "web_extract_v1" }`
- No `tool_context` required

## Basic request and response

```bash
curl -X POST "https://{base_url}/gpt/v1/messages/validate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "default",
    "max_tokens": 128,
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Summarize: https://example.com/" }
    ],
    "tools": [
      { "name": "web_extract", "type": "web_extract_v1" }
    ],
    "tool_choice": { "type": "auto" }
  }'
```

Example response:

```json
{ "valid": true, "errors": null }
```

To run the request, send the same body to `POST /messages`.

## Tips

- Be explicit in the user message about what you want from the page (summary, key facts, etc.).
- If your deployment restricts outbound network access, Web Extract may be disabled.
