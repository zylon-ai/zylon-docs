# Database Connector

The Database Connector allows you to securely connect a shared database to a **Project**, making its data available to all project members through chat.

> **Important change**: Database connectors are no longer added directly inside a chat. They are now **project-level shared connectors**, managed from the Project sidebar.

---

## Creating a Database Connector

To create a database connector:

1. Open your **Project Sidebar**
2. Click **Connectors**
3. Click **Create connector**
4. Select **Database**
5. Enter the required **connection details**
6. Establish the connection

Once the connection is successful, additional configuration options become available.

## Advanced Configuration

After the database connection has been established, you can configure advanced parameters to control how the database is used.

### Table and Schema Restrictions

You can limit the connector’s access to:
- Specific **schemas**
- Specific **tables**

This helps:
- Reduce unnecessary data exposure
- Improve query accuracy
- Prevent the LLM from querying irrelevant data

### Connector Description

You can define a **description** for the database connector.
This description is provided to the LLM and should explain:

- What the database contains
- How the data is structured
- Any important rules or conventions

A good description significantly improves the quality of queries generated by the LLM.

## Using the Database Connector in Chat

Once created, the database connector can be used in chats:

1. Open or create a chat within the project
2. Use the **Connectors selector** in the chat input
3. Enable the database connector

When enabled, the LLM can query the database as part of the conversation.

## Pre-Selected Connectors

Project administrators can configure database connectors to be **pre-selected for every new chat** in the project.

This is especially useful when:
- The database is a core part of the project workflow
- Non-technical users should not manage connector selection
- Consistent data access is required across all conversations

---

## Personal and Private Usage

If a user wants to configure their **own database connectors** without sharing them:

1. Create a **private project**
2. Create database connectors using the same process
3. Use them exclusively within that private project

Private projects allow experimentation or personal integrations without affecting shared environments.

---

## Requirements and Considerations

- The database must be reachable from the connector environment
- Network access, firewalls, and IP allowlists may need configuration
- Queries generated by the LLM respect the connector’s configured scope

---

## Security

- Credentials are stored securely
- The LLM can only access data allowed by the connector configuration
- Schema and table restrictions are enforced at query time
