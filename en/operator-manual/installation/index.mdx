Zylon supports three installation modes to accommodate different network environments. Choose the one that best fits your security and connectivity requirements.

| Feature | Online | Semi-Airgap | Airgap |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Internet Access | Full | Limited | None on target |
| Setup Complexity | Simple | Moderate | Complex |
| Security Level | Standard | High | Maximum |
| Update Process | Simple | Required manual work | Pseudo-manual |
| Proxy Support | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Installation Time | ~30-90 min | ~1-2 hours | ~2-3 hours |
| Update Time | ~15-40 min | ~30-60 min | ~1-2 hours |
| Requires downtime for updates | Not common, or minutes | Not common, or minutes | Always, 15-60 min |

This table summarizes the key differences between the three installation modes. Detailed guides for each mode are provided below.

### Understanding better the Installation Modes

#### Online Installation

**Overview**: The Zylon server has full, unrestricted access to the internet. It can download packages, container images, and updates directly from official repositories and registries.

**Features**:
- **Setup Complexity**: Straightforward installation using a single command. The installer automatically downloads and configures all required components. Minimal technical expertise required.
- **Security Level**: Standard security appropriate for most business environments. The server can communicate outbound to download updates and access external services.
- **Update Process**: Fully automated. Run a single update command and the system downloads and applies all updates automatically. Can be scheduled using cron jobs for hands-off maintenance.
- **Proxy Support**: Supported if needed
- **Installation Time**: ~30-90 minutes depending on your network speed and hardware
- **Update Time**: ~15-40 minutes. Downtime is not common, or just a few minutes when required.

---

#### Semi-Airgap Installation

**Overview**: The server has limited or controlled internet access, typically through a proxy or firewall with whitelisted domains.

**Features**:
- **Setup Complexity**: Moderate. Requires network configuration (proxy settings, firewall rules). You'll need to coordinate with your network security team to whitelist specific domains and ports.
- **Security Level**: Enhanced security through network isolation and controlled access points. Reduces exposure to internet-based threats while maintaining update capabilities through controlled channels.
- **Update Process**: Updates require manual intervention to download update packages on a connected machine, and then apply them. Coordination with network security teams may be needed for installing/updating.
- **Proxy Support**: Supported and typically required
- **Installation Time**: ~1-2 hours including network configuration
- **Update Time**: ~30-60 minutes. Downtime is not common, or just a few minutes when required.

#### Airgap Installation

**Overview**: The target server has no internet connection whatsoever. All installation files, container images, and dependencies must be transferred from a connected machine to the isolated target server using offline media (USB drives, internal network transfers, etc.).

**Features**:
- **Setup Complexity**: Most complex setup requiring a staging machine with internet access, manual transfer of large installation bundles (70-100 GB), and careful coordination between the connected and isolated environments.
- **Security Level**: Highest security posture for sensitive environments (government, defense, healthcare, finance). Complete isolation from external networks eliminates internet-based attack vectors entirely. Ideal for compliance with strict security frameworks (NIST, FedRAMP, classified environments).
- **Update Process**: Pseudo-manual process requiring the use of a connected machine to download update bundles, transfer them offline to the target server, and apply them through the CLI. Plan for 1-2 hour maintenance windows for major updates. This will often cause downtime for Zylon services during the update process.
- **Proxy Support**: Not applicable (no internet connection)
- **Installation Time**: ~2-3 hours including file transfers
- **Update Time**: ~1-2 hours. Always requires 15-60 minutes of downtime.
