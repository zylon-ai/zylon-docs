  - Keep your agent’s name under 20 characters.
  - Avoid using mixed casing (e.g., “MyAIAssistant”).

  ## Changes required before updating to Zylon 1.27.3

  Nvidia CUDA drivers need to be updated to version 12.9. To do that, follow these steps:

  1. Update Zylon-CLI:

  ```bash
  sudo zylon-cli self-update
  ```

  1. (Optional) Do a [backup using
     zylon-cli](Backups%20and%20Disaster%20Recovery%2019600531e9a780f2b1c1c15603d50837.md) before starting the process.
  2. Prepare and update Nvidia Drivers and Toolkit:

  ```bash
  sudo zylon-cli setup
  ```

  1. Reboot machine and check that `nvidia-smi` is working well:

  ```bash
  sudo reboot
  nvidia-smi
  ```

  1. Update Zylon to 1.27.0 using:

  ```bash
  sudo zylon-cli update
  ```
</Update>

  ### Sharepoint connector

  ![Screenshot 2025-04-24 at 19.44.14.png](https://i.imgur.com/Zftol5l.png)

  **Other features:**

  - Observability framework
  - Now a tooltip with the complete name is shown when a source name is too long in Knowledge Base.

  **Bugfixes and improvements:**

  - Reset custom instructions modal to empty state when it was closed without saving
  - The flow to add users manually to an organization has been improved to make it easier.
  - Usability improvements in several application flows

  **Changes required due to the new Observability metrics framework**

  In order to provide a better support in case something goes south, in this version we have updated how the
  observability framework works by including a new tool based on Grafana, beyond the crash reporting mechanism we had
  with Sentry. To make it work, please ensure that your firewall is not blocking connections to any of these websites:

  - sentry.io (you should have this already properly configured)
  - \*.grafana.net (this is the new one required)

  Remember that any data we send is completely anonymous and aggregated, and will help us to diagnose any
  malfunctioning in the platform and understand how Zylon is being used to expedite support actions.

  For those wanting to know more about what has changed, we have evolved the old config file:

  ```yaml
  sentry:
  enabled: true
  environment: "my-company"
  ```

  to this new and more granular one:

  ```yaml
  observability:
  crashReporting: true
  usageMetrics: true
  
  companyIdentifier: "my-company"
  ```

  In case you want to opt out of this, you can add the following snippet to the configuration file, but remember that
  doing so will let us blind against any support action from our side:

  ```yaml
  observability:
  crashReporting: false
  usageMetrics: false
  ```
</Update>

<Update label="1.23.10" description="April 9, 2025">
  ### New Features

  - The file picker allows multi file upload

  ### Bugfixes

  - Improved Claromentis integration to account for symlinked files which crashed the integration. Symlinks are not
    ingested.
  - Made Claromentis file pulling more resilient. A failed file won’t crash the ingestion process; the file will be
    marked as failed and the process will continue.
</Update>

<Update label="1.23.1" description="April 7, 2025">
  ## **Enhanced AI Editor**

  We've completely revamped the text editor in Agent Flows, focusing on improved functionality and a better user

  - **CSV export for tables**: Download the results of Bulk Q&A or any other table as a CSV file.
  - **Improved UX**: Enjoy a more flexible table editing experience and more versatile text editing features.

  ## **Knowledge Base Search**

  We've added a dedicated search bar to the Knowledge Base page of each Project so you can find content faster.

  ## **EML support**

  The platform now supports the popular EML email format. Upload your .eml files and use them in Chats and Agent Flows
  to summarize long threads, query specific information, and more.

  ## **CSV Export in Chat**

  You can now download tables from Chat conversations as CSV files.
</Update>
