Use **agent flows** instead of chat when you need **comprehensive processing**:

- **Long files / full‑document coverage** (e.g., 300‑page RFPs).
- Batch operations (ask many questions at once).
- Drafting longer documents from multiple sources.
- Structured extraction at scale.

Agent flows **run in the background**, so they aren’t optimized for fast, partial answers—**they process everything that’s required from the knowledge base** to produce complete results.

The result is an editable document that can be exported as a PDF or a Word document for further edition.
