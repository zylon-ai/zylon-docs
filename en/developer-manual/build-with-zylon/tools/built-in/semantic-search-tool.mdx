Use Semantic Search when you want the assistant to retrieve information from previously ingested artifacts (documents, notes, PDFs, HTML, and more).

## Prerequisites

- An API token. See [Token Management](/en/api-reference/token-management).
- Ingested artifacts to search (see [Artifacts API](/en/developer-manual/build-with-zylon/working-with-artifacts)).

## Requirements

- Tool spec: `{ "name": "semantic_search", "type": "semantic_search_v1" }`
- `tool_context`: at least one `ingested_artifact` with a `context_filter`

## Basic request and response

This example validates a request that enables semantic search over a collection:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://{base_url}/gpt/v1/messages/validate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "default",
    "max_tokens": 128,
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "What shipped in the latest billing dashboard release?" }
    ],
    "tools": [
      { "name": "semantic_search", "type": "semantic_search_v1" }
    ],
    "tool_choice": { "type": "auto" },
    "tool_context": [
      {
        "type": "ingested_artifact",
        "context_filter": {
          "collection": "docs_examples",
          "artifacts": ["docs_file_artifact"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Example response:

```json
{ "valid": true, "errors": null }
```

To run the request, send the same body to `POST /messages`.

## Tips

- Keep `tool_context` narrow (use a single collection and the smallest set of artifacts you need).
- If you’re not getting relevant results, ingest cleaner source text (or split large documents into smaller artifacts).
