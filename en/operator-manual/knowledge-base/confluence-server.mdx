title: Confluence Server
---

Zylon integrates directly with **Confluence Server / Data Center** using the **Confluence REST API**
No Atlassian application, OAuth configuration, or external services are required.

---

## Requirements

- A running *Confluence Data Server* instance
- A **Confluence user account** with access to the Spaces you want to import
- Network access from Zylon to the Confluence instance

---

## Authentication

Zylon authenticates using **Basic Authentication**:

- **Username**: Confluence username
- **Password**: Confluence password

The permissions available to Zylon are exactly the permissions of the user you authenticate with.

---

## Configure Zylon

Edit the Zylon configuration file located at:

```bash
/etc/zylon/zylon-conf.yaml
```

<Tip> The configuration file is YAML. Be careful with indentation, spaces, and quoting. </Tip>

Add the following configuration:
```yaml
integration:
  confluenceLocal:
    enabled: true
    domain: "http://your-confluence-domain:8090"
```

Configuration fields

**enabled**
Enables the Confluence Server connector.

**domain**
Base URL of your Confluence Server instance.

Examples:
http://confluence.company.local:8090
https://confluence.company.com

## Troubleshooting

### I try to upload files to the knowledge base and Confluence button is greyed out

Clear the browser cache and try again.

### When I click on `Upload files -> From Confluence` the log in is not working

- Check that the `domain` copy pasted correctly into Zylon config file
- Check that the `username` and `password` used are correct.

### I don’t see any space to import

- Make sure you have logged in into Confluence with an account that has access to spaces.
