When company repositories (e.g., **SharePoint**) and files are connected and imported into project knowledge bases, those files are **indexed**. Search returns them alongside your other workspace items.

- Type keywords or concepts; matching documents appear with their **source**.
- Select a result to open the file context or the chat/flow where itâ€™s referenced.

> You only see items from repositories and projects you have permission to access.
