Zylon comes with a built-in [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/),
which will help you monitor and diagnose issues with your installation.

To enable it, you will need to edit your config file at `/etc/zylon/zylon-conf.yaml` and add the following section:
```yaml
adminDashboard:
  enabled: true
  exposeIngress: true
```

Next, update your Zylon system by running:
```bash
sudo zylon-cli sync
```

Once the update completes, access the dashboard at:
`https://<zylon.company.com>/kube-dashboard`

To login, you can generate a short-lived token:
```bash
kubectl -n zylon create token zylon
```
Or a permanent token:
```bash
kubectl get secret zylon-token -n zylon -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d
```

<Warning>
    The permanent token will provide full admin access to your Kubernetes cluster.
    Keep it secret and secure.
</Warning>

<Tip>
    Zylon uses multiple namespaces, you can check the status of each.
    Select the right namespace from the dropdown on the top left corner.

    * zylon: Zylon system components
    * openebs: OpenEBS storage system
    * nvidia: NVIDIA controller and device plugin
</Tip>


After logging in, you will be able to see the status of your Zylon installation, including:
- Pods
- Logs
- Basic metrics regarding CPU and memory usage
