There are two collaboration models:

## 1) Available to everyone in the organization
- Make the project visible to **all current and future members**.
- Assign a default role: **Viewer** or **Editor**.
  - **Viewer:** can start chats and agent flows (e.g., summarize documents) but **cannot change the knowledge base**.
  - **Editor:** can modify the project’s knowledge base (add/remove content).

Projects shared org‑wide display the **organization icon**.

## 2) Invite specific people
- Invite by name and choose a role per person: **Viewer**, **Editor**, or **Admin**.
- The **owner** (creator) can **transfer ownership** if needed.
- Shared projects show the **owner’s avatar with a member count**.

> **Private → Collaborative chats:** When starting a chat you can choose **Personal** (private) or **Collaborative** (shared with project members). Private chats can later be **converted to collaborative** (this **cannot be undone**).
