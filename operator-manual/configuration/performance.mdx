## Docling

To fine-tune the machine resources, and be able to use all machine resources in ingestion process, we provide the following configuration to configure based on the machine:

### Performance Configuration

1. **Number of workers**: This is the configuration that determines how many workers Docling will have. We recommend leaving it at 2, where 1 worker will process large files and the other will process smaller files.
2. **Number of threads**: This configuration will be used to limit the capacity that our internal extraction service will use. Consider that this number should be lower to the maximum cores that machine has.

**Important**: The number of threads must be divisible by the number of workers.

In case you want to test and improve the performance, consider configure as:

```yaml
external:
  docling:
    numWorkers: M
    numThreads: N
```

### Optional Configuration

1. **Table mode**: Controls the table extraction strategy:
   - `accurate`: Maximum precision for complex tables. Higher processing time. Default option.
   - `fast`: Optimized for speed with good accuracy. Lower processing time.
   - `none`: Disables table extraction. No processing time.

2. **Do cell matching**: Enables matching of table cells to improve structure recognition. Recommended for complex tables. By default is `true`.

3. **Force full page OCR**: Forces OCR processing on entire pages instead of selective regions. Use when standard extraction misses content. This will increase the processing time significantly. By default is `false`.

```yaml
external:
  docling:
    tableMode: "accurate"
    doCellMatching: true
    forceFullPageOCR: false
```
