## Docling

To fine-tuning the machine resources, and be able to use all machine resources in ingestion process, we provide the following configuration to configure based on the machine:

1. **Number of workers**: This is the configuration that determines how many workers Docling will have. We recommend leaving it at 2, where 1 worker will process large files and the other will process smaller files.
2. **Number of threads**: This configuration will be used to limit the capacity that our internal extraction service will use. Consider that this number should be lower to the maximum cores that machine has.

**Important**: The number of threads must be divisible by the number of workers.

In case you want to test and improve the performance, consider configure as:

```yaml
external:
	docling:
        numWorkers: M
		numThreads: N
```
